Four factors have been identified as key contributors to change in the alternative finance domain, globalisation, technology, consumer needs and demands and financial innovation. Constant technological improvements are creating a competitive environment between firms within the alternative finance domain.

Policy changes covering the focus of regulation and compliance are for rapidly expanding and driving innovation rates within the industry. Rising interest rates make money more expensive to borrow hurd individuals and corporations to source funds from alternative avenues if declined by traditional lenders.
